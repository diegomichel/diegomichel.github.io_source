I dont update this blog as much as i would like, and it was using wordpress with mysql, which seems to be a waste of resources, so i will give a go to [gohugo.io](http://gohugo.io) which was recommended to me by [Frank from EmberIgniter](http://emberigniter.com).

GoHugo is website platform that works by generating the html files and then you can publish them. There is not admin section like in wordpress, that means you can/have to do everything from the CLI, generate the content and upload it to your server.

So how it's my setup

1. Hugo and markdown files hosted with [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org)
2. A copy on my personal laptop where i update and do push either to bitbucket or my server
3. Server running [G-Wan](http://gwan.com)
