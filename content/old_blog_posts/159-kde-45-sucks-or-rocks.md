What Sucks:

1. Plasma desktop isn't so great in the way i like to work, i dont know what do with the applets...
2. Sound get jammed when using VLC and the system play any sound.
3. Konqueror don't work with gmail, even changing the browser identification. 
What Rocks
1. My two monitors works OOB
2. Window Management is great ala Windows 7
3. Expose like effect like in Mac Leopard.
4. Apps don't crash that much like 4.4 and 4.3, so far i have only have one problem with policy-kit crashing on start.
5. Effects are awesome.
Conclusion: I don't know if stick with kde4 or go back to dwm, i have hard times making decisions so...
