So i was checking my Facebook map, that shows where i have been... and guess what it shows a location where i never been...  Now you may think that maybe my password have been hacked or something... but its very unlikely.  Well here is the map, it shows an access from Chicago... and well i have never been out from mexico. So its a red flag right there.  [![facebook map spy](http://www.diegomichel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/umh-300x187.jpg)](http://www.diegomichel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/umh.jpg)  And now with all the NSA scandal...  What do you think? maybe a bot that fetch all your history to build a database, just an error?
